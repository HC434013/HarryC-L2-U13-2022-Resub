 ### PR1
> Excellent selection of phone from low-end to high-end,
would prefer if prices were advertised on the browse page, website scales weird on my display, probably expects 1080p but my display is 720pish, walls of text are hard to read, would prefer a mere quote of a review and clicking phone models on the main page does not link to the phones themselves like expected.

### PR2
> There is a very large selection of phones of all brands, would be nice if you had the prices labeled before clicking in the details of the phone, i quite like the simple design of the website its not too crouded and when looking at more details you can remove the specs list, when on the home page when clicking the phone model it doesnt link to the phone its self, i personally would have a long amount of text on the home page i would have a small quote then add the long text after clicking on the phone its self.

+ What I would do better following these reviews:
+ Provide more need to know information on a large list of products rather than just an image and the product name
+ Expand device compatibility, as it only scales for 1080p displays and doesn't scale for phones either
+ Accomodate for those that prefer short form and long form information. Like a summary alongside the expandable spec sheet. Also include a review section for product owners
+ Add shortcuts to the product when showcased elsewhere on the website
+ The part about compatibility also makes me think wider on accessibility as a whole
