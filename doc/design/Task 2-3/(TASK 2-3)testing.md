# Testing Plan (conceived during development)
### Testers
I tested the website solely on my own, using a chromium browser configured at 100% zoom on a 1920x2080 display


### Routine
 My testing sessions performed numerously throughout development consisted of interacting with every interactable element of the site in the way a typical end user would. These tests were done to ensure functionality and consistency in UX/UI design for the complete project.

- First and foremost, I would make sure every button that directed to another page functioned and was correctly labelled.
- I ensured formatting for UX design was consistent on the navbar (name of open section is emboldened)
- Another side of element testing was the Bootstrap used throughout the project:
- Every product listing has a collapsable specification sheet and part of testing was to ensure that they were all closed upon loading the product page. I also used this to check the formatting consistency across all pages for this element. I also made heavy use of carousels, and testing of this element consisted of just scrolling through the included media with both forward and backward buttons, making sure the buttons worked and no files were missing.
