## Customers

+ Basic and advanced product information for people with just a few needs and those that want to know everything about what they're buying 
+ Easy to navigate with nothing being too buried under other elements of the site
+ Quick page loading (at least under 3s) so that the users attention isn't lost

## Owners/Stakeholders

+ Has to look good, unattractive websites can push users away. Minimalism has taken a toll on design and marketing as a whole in the last decade, so creating a website with simplistic flair (example: www.apple.com) would be attractive to wider customer bases and stakeholders.
+ Professional, shouldn't contain mistakes or visual design flaws
+ Generate business, include nod after nod to try and get the sale from the customer
+ Cheap as to make a profit sooner, as many startups fail to turn a profit on the first couple years and it often results in going under

## Developers

+ Well documented with comments everywhere in the code so it is easily known what everything does
+ Easy to maintain so that downtime and maintenance is minimal
+ Easy to test so that new features can be tested and added quickly
+ Uses widely known website standards (HTTPS, secure payment portals)
