### Scheme 1
+ A monochromatic palette consisting of a few shiny shades of blue.
+ Many phone shop sites tend to use blues, namely carphone warehouse, tesco mobile and O2.
+ A reason why phone shops tend to hover around the colour blue is because it symbolises electricity and technology in general, it could prove effective when drawing a customer to pick out a new phone.

+ Primary color:

  shade 0 = #1C55FF = rgb( 28, 85,255) = rgba( 28, 85,255,1) = rgb0(0.11,0.333,1)

  shade 1 = #AEC2FF = rgb(174,194,255) = rgba(174,194,255,1) = rgb0(0.682,0.761,1)

  shade 2 = #80A0FF = rgb(128,160,255) = rgba(128,160,255,1) = rgb0(0.502,0.627,1)

  shade 3 = #002592 = rgb(  0, 37,146) = rgba(  0, 37,146,1) = rgb0(0,0.145,0.573)

  shade 4 = #001C71 = rgb(  0, 28,113) = rgba(  0, 28,113,1) = rgb0(0,0.11,0.443)

### Scheme 2
+ A set of three adjacent colours consisting of a few yellows and greens.
+ Similar to EE's colour scheme, reason could be to stand out from the other phone shops that tend to use blues.
+ I also couldn't really find any other decent schemes that could fit a high street phone shopping website

   shade 0 = #57C00D = rgb( 87,192, 13) = rgba( 87,192, 13,1) = rgb0(0.341,0.753,0.051)

 ### Scheme 3 (CHOSEN)

 + No extra colour. Just a dead white background. Could prove well experimentally compared to all the other sites having flashy palettes.
 + Maybe there is an audience for such basic web design? Those that just want the cold hard facts about their devices with a few pictures and not a flurry of bright colours and sleek animation blocking out everything worth seeing
 + In defense of it looking *too* bland, maybe the imagery for the products could fill in any aesthetic void this risky palette would result in.

 + I have opted for this on my chosen design because in pretty much every field, experimentation is the way forward. That and I really couldn't find many good matching colours, especially for a phone website...
