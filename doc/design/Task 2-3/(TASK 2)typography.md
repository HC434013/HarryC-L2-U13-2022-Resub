## Typography Ideas

+ Kanit Medium 500 - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kanit
+ Could be used for a large heading, maybe not a larger block of text as it displays numbers strangely.

+ Roboto Regular 400 - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto
+ Simple and legible, fits the minimalistic approach of most online shops trying to sell you a product. 
+ Appears suitable for larger blocks of text containing product information 

+ Ramabhadra Regular 400 - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ramabhadra
+ Developed for use with headlines and large sizes, could be considered over Kanit seeing that headlines are a specialty here

+ I have chosen Roboto and Ramabhadra on my chosen design as primary fonts.
