## Strengths and Weaknesses
### SourceForge
**Strengths**
- Provides a good platform for developers in both independent and enterprise sectors
- Good colour scheme, orange isn't usually associated with computers or software but with the light association with orange code markers in an IDE justifies the choice from the owners of SourceForge, seeing as they're making a site "for developers, by developers"
- Provides a wide array of features along with just being a software distribution site, such as tickets, reviews and mailing lists

**Weaknesses**
- Their customer service has no live chat feature, instead you must send an email and wait up to 2 days for a ticket response.
- Developer profiles don't seem to have any ability to link a social profile or provide any direct contact point


### The PiHut
**Strengths**
- Covers the niche of single board computer projects in a well executed manner
- Support portal contains tens of articles related to common support issues
- Large resource portal containing tutorials and guides for projects with products sold on the site

**Weaknesses**
- No live chat support feature, you must submit a ticket and await a response
- Email newsletters are quite outdated nowadays
